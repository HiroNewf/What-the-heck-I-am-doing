# Basic info
This is going to be where I talk about the steps I am taking to get into Cybersecurity and Penetration testing, from learning coding to getting certifications. It will all be talked about here. I have done some learning prior to the stuff listed here but it was nothing major and was just random courses from cybrary here and there many of which I have forgotten so I am not going to bother mentioning them. I am currently 15 (as of August 2021) and I have tons of free time due the fact that I am homeschooled. I am trying to utilize that free time as best as possible to help me get a head start in my Cyber Security career. I have set some goals for myself in terms of what I want to get done before I turn 18 and get my first full time job.                                                                                               
Some of my goals/ things I want to learn are listed below (these are for the next 3 years, I have some other goals for further into the future):
* Network+ cert                                                                                                                                                       
* Security+ cert
* Pentest+ cert
* Learn to use Python to automate pentesting tasks
* Popular OS's (Linux, Unix, Windows, & maybe MacOS)
* Bash
* Powershell
* Batch
* Pentesting software (Nmap/Zenmap, Wireshark, Metaspliot, ect)

Long term goals
* Get a job in Penetration testing
* OSCP
* Salary of 100k USD
* Post informative content on youtube about Offensive security

## Major Acomplishments so far

## June 2021 through __ (Network+)
I have given myself from now until the end of the year (7 months from now) to get my Network+ certification. I will be using many resources such as Cybrarys' and Professor Messers' courses. In order to not flood this page with tons of information I am just going to link to another page which explains in depth what I am doing to get my network+ cert. So go and read [this](https://github.com/HiroNewf/Network-Plus) if you wanna know more about this step.

## Late July 2021 and onward (Python)
Learning a coding language can be quite useful for automating certain tasks when penetration testing and since I already have some familiarity with Python, it is quite easy to learn and there are tons of resources out there for it, I am picking Python for my language to learn. From what I have heard from others though, which language you pick for penetration testing doesn't really matter as long as you create the tools you might need. But much like for the Network+ I am not going to put too much info here and I am going to link to another page with all the info [here](https://github.com/HiroNewf/Learning-Python)

## Start of August and onward (TryHackMe)
I have known that [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) existed for a while now, but I just got around to actually checking it out. I made an account and tried out a few things. I have started the Offensive Pentesting learning path and it is quite good so far. I am considering getting the premium access, but I am probably going to make sure I really like it first by just using the free version for a couple weeks or so. Premium version is $10/month for anyone that is wondering.

## How long I spend working on stuff
My current goal is to work on studying something for at least 4 hours each weekday. Not really sure what my plans for the weekends are going to be yet. That will probably be where I work on personal projects like coding and stuff instead of any kind of guided studying, but we'll have to see.
