# Basic info
This is going to be where I talk about the steps I am taking to get into Cybersecurity and Penetration testing, from learning coding to getting certifications it will all be talked about here. I have done some learning prior to the stuff listed here but it was nothing major and was just random courses from cybrary here and there many of which I have forgotten so I am not going to bother mentioning them. 

## June 2021 through __ (Network+)
I have giving myself from now until the end of the year (7 months from now) to get my Network+ certification. I will be using many resources such as Cybrarys' and Prodessor Messers' courses. In order to not flood this page with tons of information I am just going to link to another page which explains in depth what I am doing to get my netowrk+ cert. So go and read [this](https://github.com/HiroNewf/Network-Plus) if you wanna know more about this step.
