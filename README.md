# Basic info
This is going to be where I talk about the steps I am taking to get into Cybersecurity and Penetration testing, from learning coding to getting certifications it will all be talked about here. I have done some learning prior to the stuff listed here but it was nothing major and was just random courses from cybrary here and there many of which I have forgotten so I am not going to bother mentioning them.

## June 2021 through __ (Network+)
I have giving myself from now until the end of the year (7 months from now) to get my Network+ certification. I will be using many resources such as Cybrarys' and Professor Messers' courses. In order to not flood this page with tons of information I am just going to link to another page which explains in depth what I am doing to get my network+ cert. So go and read [this](https://github.com/HiroNewf/Network-Plus) if you wanna know more about this step.

## Late July 2021 and onward (Python)
Learning a coding language can be quite useful for automating certain tasks when penetration testing and since I already have some familiarity with Python, it is quite easy to learn and there are tons of resources out there for it, I am picking Python for my language to learn. From what I have heard from others though, which language you pick for penetration testing doesn't really matter as long as you create the tools you might need. But much likely for the Network+ I am not going to put too much info here and I am going to link to another page with all the info [here](https://github.com/HiroNewf/Learning-Python)
